# Technical support

Our Help Center team is there to help you with any question or problem you encounter while using freistilbox.

## Support channels

You can reach our Help Center team via several channels:

* web: our [ticket system](http://support.freistilbox.com)
* email: our ticket system address
  [support@freistilbox.com](mailto:support@freistilbox.com)
* phone: our support hotline [+49 761 458 955 99](tel://+4976145895599)

Regardless of the channel you use to reach out to us, each (non-trivial) support
request will be documented in a dedicated support ticket. Each ticket has a
unique ID number that makes it easy to reference. All questions and comments
regarding the issue at hand will be stored in this ticket, so they can be
revisited at any time with complete context.

To make it easy to track — for you as well as for us — which aspects of your
support requests are already handled and which ones still need action, we ask
you to separate each different topic into a dedicated support request. **Please
do not mix unrelated topics in a single ticket** since it will become confusing
very quickly.

### Contact via web

To manage your support requests in your web browser, simply visit our [ticket system](http://support.freistilbox.com). You can create your own user
account there if you don't already have one. Then, just click the "New ticket"
link to issue a new support request.

### Contact via email

To send us your support request via email, write to
[support@freistilbox.com](mailto:support@freistilbox.com). The Help Center
website will automatically create a new ticket and notify you of the new ticket
ID in an email response.

By replying to an Help Center email, you can add comments to the ticket. Please
do not remove the ticket ID from the email subject because the Help Center would
then store your response in a newly created ticket instead of adding it to the
existing one.

### Contact via phone

If you decide to call us, you can speed up the support process by first issuing
a written new support request. Otherwise, the Help Center agent will create a
new ticket for you by asking you for the essential details explained in the next
section.

Outside of the 12x5 timeframe, you will be connected to our Help Center
voicemail system. To save yourself the effort of recording all the problem
details explained below, please provide them to us in a written support request
and then simply leave us the ticket ID on voicemail. Your message will be sent
immediately to our on-call engineers who will get back to you immediately after
reviewing your support ticket.

## Essential details

If you need to report a problem, please try to answer the following questions as
precise as possible:

* **WHAT:** What are the symptoms of the problem?
* **WHERE:** Which websites are affected by the problem? If possible, mention
  the site ID of at least one affected website.
* **WHEN:** When was the problem first detected and, if it was only temporary,
  when did it end?
* **WHO:** What are your email address and your phone number? The best place to
  provide us with this information is your Help Center user account.

Here is an example support request that covers all the essential details:

>"[WHAT:] We noticed error messages ("error 503") [WHERE:] on our website
www.example.com (site ID s007). [WHEN:] The problem started circa 14:20 CET and
at 14:35, the site started working okay again. [WHO:] Please contact me via
email at mail@example.com or via phone 123456".

In similar fashion, if you just have a question or need us to perform a certain
task (for example, a change to your hosting configuration), make sure to give us
as much information as possible from the start. The fewer roundtrips we need to
clarify the issue, the faster we'll be able to finish your support request.
