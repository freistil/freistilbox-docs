# Technical support

Our support team is there to help you with any question or problem you encounter
while using freistilbox.

You can reach our support team via the [freistilbox
Dashboard](https://dashboard.freistilbox.com). Simply log in and you'll get
help quickly.

## Support chat

On the bottom right of every page, you'll find the **support chat** button. By
clicking this button, you can send your request directly to our support team.

This communication channel is best suited for:

* general questions
* issues that don't require significant analysis

<span class="label notice">NOTICE</span> In case we're not able to respond to
your request right away, you don't have to keep the Dashboard page open in your
browser and wait. As soon as there's an update from our team, you'll
automatically get an email.

## Support ticket

For more complex problems, we recommend that you create a formal **support
ticket**.  You'll find the link "Contact support" in the "Support" section of
your website's details page:

This will create a new ticket in the freistilbox Help Center in which we'll
document the whole support process. All questions and comments regarding the issue
will be stored in this ticket, so they can be revisited at any time with
complete context. For easy reference, each support ticket gets a unique ID number
that makes it easy to reference. When a support ticket is created or updated by
our support team, our Help Center will send you an email. You can respond to
updates either by replying to this email or by clicking the link pointing to our
Help Center website and writing your answer there.

<span class="label important">IMPORTANT</span> To make your support requests
easy to track, we ask you to create a separate support request for each issue.
**Please do not mix unrelated topics in a single ticket** since this will become
confusing very quickly.

Our support team will also create support tickets directly from the support chat
if this helps resolving the matter more efficiently.

## Essential details

If you need to report a problem, please try to answer the following questions as
precise as possible:

* **WHAT:** What are the symptoms of the problem?
* **WHERE:** Which websites are affected by the problem? If possible, mention
  the site ID of at least one affected website.
* **WHEN:** When was the problem first detected and, if it was only temporary,
  when did it end?
* **WHO:** What are your email address and your phone number? The best place to
  provide us with this information is your Help Center user account.

Here is an example support request that covers all the essential details:

>"[WHAT:] We noticed error messages ("error 503") [WHERE:] on our website
www.example.com (site ID s007). [WHEN:] The problem started circa 14:20 CET and
at 14:35, the site started working okay again. [WHO:] Please contact me via
email at mail@example.com or via phone 123456".

These things might help, too:

* a relevant code or configuration snippet
* a screenshot of an error message
* a link to some instructions you followed

_Always make sure to give us as much information as possible. The fewer
roundtrips we need to clarify the issue, the faster we'll be able to get it
resolved._
